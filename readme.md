## API

### psList(options?)

Returns a `Promise<object[]>` with the running processes.

On macOS and Linux, the `name` property is truncated to 15 characters by the system. The `cmd` property can be used to extract the full name.

The `cmd`, `cpu`, `memory`, and `uid` properties are not supported on Windows.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### all

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Include other users' processes as well as your own.

On Windows this has no effect and will always be the users' own processes.
